              "When picking between pixels and rems, here's the question you
              should be asking yourself: 'Should this value scale up as the user
              increases their browser's default font size?'' This question is
              the root of the mental model I use. If the value should increase
              with the default font size, I use rem. Otherwise, I use px." -Josh
              Comeau
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Use <span>rem for font sizes</span>, because using pixels overrides
            a user's font size choice, and is therefore less accessible for
            people with poor vision. Using rem means the font size will scale
            with whatever font size is set as their default. Default is 16px but
            user's can change it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Use rem for media queries</span> as well. This may seem
            counterintuitive, because the mobile layout may end up being viewed
            on a laptop if the user's default font size is bigger than normal,
            but that's actually a good thing. If they need the font to be large,
            the mobile layout will look best.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Using rem with height and width</span> can also be a good
            idea, because it will preserve buttons and other elements'
            proportions in relation to the font size within them, however, it
            can also make elements become too big to fit on mobile, if the user
            font size is increased too much. To prevent this, set the element's
            max-width to 100%, so it won't get bigger than the size of the
            screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            But using rem on padding and margins means those will also increase
            if the user increases their default font size, so it might be best
            to use
            <span>pixels for padding and margin</span>. The exception would be
            vertical margins, if you want the space to increase between lines to
            maintain readability there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still not sure which to use? Test it. Change your browser's font
            size and play with rem and pixels and see which makes the best user
            experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            There's also <span>vh (viewing height)</span> and
            <span>vw (viewing width)</span> that are pretty handy to fill the
            screen, but a word of caution, <span>vh</span> DOES NOT work well on
            mobile and is best to avoid.

          <h2 id="images">Images</h2>
          <p>
            Images are replaced items that are embedded in the DOM. They aren't
            actual elements in the DOM. This can make images do unpredictable
            things when styling them. It's a good idea to wrap images in a div
            and style the div instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another great way to wrap an image is with the
            <span>&lt;figure&gt;</span> HTML element. The figure element is a
            block element that works great with <span>&lt;figcaption&gt;</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The browser thinks of images as text, so it will automatically put a
            few pixels of line height beneath images. If you don't want it
            there, set images to <span>display: block</span> or to
            <span>line-height: 0</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML is space-sensitive, so it will put whitespace between
            side-by-side images. If you don't want it there, remove spaces
            between the side-by-side &lt;img&gt; tags.
          </p>
          <h2 id="width">Width</h2>
          <p>
            You can set width by using rem (recommended), pixels, and
            percentages.
          </p>
          <p>
            With <span>percentages</span>, it's important to remember the width
            will be calculated based off of the parent's container, so if your
            div is set to 50% width, it will take up half of the available width
            of the parent.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <h4>Width Keywords</h4>
            <li>
              <p><span>Width: min-content</span></p>
              <p class="indent-2">
                Calculates width based off the child element. If text, it will
                cause it to wrap to be as small of a width as possible. If a
                block element, it will shrink to fit child.
              </p>
              <p><span>Width: max-content</span></p>
              <p class="indent-2">
                Also bases width on child element, but max-content
                <em>never</em> wraps. That means your text will simply run off
                the page and not be visible.
              </p>
              <p><span>Width: fit-content</span></p>
              <p class="indent-2">
                Fit-content is magic. It also bases width on the child element,
                like both of the above, but whereas min-content shrinks text to
                one word on a line, and max-content cuts off the excess that
                doesn't fit on one line, fit-content is smart. It will allow the
                words to fill up the line, then wrap when needed. Yay.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2 id="height">Height</h2>
          <p>
            Most of the time, setting the height isn't desirable. We want our
            pages to be able to expand for any size of content.
          </p>
          <p>
            But there's one case you might want to set a height, and that's if
            you only have a tiny amount of content on a page, but you still want
            that container to fill the screen. You might think to use
            <span>100 vh</span> (viewing height), but it doesn't always work
            exactly. The answer is min-height, but
            <em
              >min-height only works if you set a height for the parent
              containers</em
            >. That's because the height of the &lt;body&gt; element defaults to
            shrink to the size of the children. You need to set
            <span>height: 100%</span> on every element before your container you
            wish to set a min-height on, including &lt;html&gt; and
            &lt;body&gt;, then set <span>min-width: 100%</span> in order for
            that element to fill the viewport height.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's important to note that Flexbox and Grid do not fix this height
            issue. So get used to setting <span>height: 100%</span> on
            &lt;html&gt; and &lt;body&gt; as well as any other parent containers
            in order to use min-height. Use this in combination with Flexbox to
            create footers that will stay at the bottom of the page.

          <h2>Caution: Maybe Just Don't Do These Things</h2>
          <div class="quote">
            "Exercise caution! It's super important that you never apply the
            following CSS: button { outline: none; } This rule is sometimes used
            to hide the blue or black ring that can accompany interacting with a
            button or link. Sometimes, designers ask us to do this. The problem
            is that this totally breaks navigation for keyboard users; that ring
            is required for them to know which element is currently focused! The
            only exception is if we provide a suitable alternative. For example:
            button { outline: none; } button:focus { background: navy; color:
            white; }" -Josh Comeau
