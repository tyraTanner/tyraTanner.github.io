          <h2 id="selectors">Selectors</h2>
          <p>
            The main CSS selectors are element, id, and class. Id and class have
            a higher specificity than an element. There are many other ways to
            combine element, classes, and pseudo-classes to target specific
            items. For a full list of combinators and pseudo-classes, check out
            <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php"
              >W3schools reference list.</a
            >
          </p>
          <h4>Combinators</h4>
          <p>
            <span>.ancestor .descendant</span> Use a space to target any
            descendants of an element, id, or class.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>.ancestor.descendant</span> No space between classes? That
            means both classes must exist on the same element.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>.mama > .child</span> Here the child must be a direct
            descendant of the parent.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>.sister ~ .brother</span> Will choose the siblings of .sister
            who have a class of .brother. They don't have to be directly
            adjacent.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>.sister + .brother</span> Siblings again. This time, they DO
            have to be directly adjacent, so that .brother follows immediately
            after .sister.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>.parents, .children</span> Party time. Give me all the parents
            and all the children.
          </p>
          <h4>Pseudo Classes</h4>
          <p>
            Pseudo classes are super useful. They allow you to pick just the
            first child of a class or element, or only set a style on mouse
            hover.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>.flashy-icon:hover</span> Set styles for the flashy-icon class
            only when the mouse hovers over it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>p:not(.uninvited)</span> Selects all p tags that DO NOT have
            the class .uninvited.
          </p>
          <h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
          <p>
            CSS variables are custom properties that you can set for any
            element.
          </p>
          <p>
            This can be useful in setting values that are used repeatedly
            throughout your project. For example, the accent color for this page
            is <span class="accent-span">#ff0063</span>. From anchor tags to
            horizontal rules, the color value must be specified repeatedly. If I
            decide to change the accent color, I will need to change it in many
            places. But if I use a CSS variable, I will only need to change the
            color in one place.
          </p>
          <p>Here's how to declare a custom property:</p>
          <div class="img-black">
            <img class="half-width" src="img/accent-color.png" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Take note of the two dashes in front of the custom name, as those
            are required to show this is a custom property. The value needs to
            be any valid CSS value.
          </p>
          <p>Now slap a "var" in front of that custom property to use it:</p>
          <div class="img-black">
            <img class="width-500" src="img/css-variable.png" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Now if I decide to change the color, I only have to do it in my
            custom property value.
          </p>
          <h4>Scope</h4>
          <p>
            CSS variables are inheritable, so if you set the custom property on
            a parent element, it will be inherited by the child as well. But
            much like scope of a Javascript function, where variables inside a
            function cannot be accessed outside of it, no elements outside of
            the parent can access that variable. That's why most of the time,
            CSS variables are declared in the html element, because every
            element is a child of the html. It's a way of making the variables
            have a global scope.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you don't want your custom properties to have a global scope, you
            can declare them in any specific CSS element.
          </p>
          <h4>Practical Uses</h4>
          <p>
            There are many more uses for CSS variables than simply decreasing
            redundancy. They can be used with Javascript to create interactive
            elements with reactive layouts, as well as in media queries and
            more.
