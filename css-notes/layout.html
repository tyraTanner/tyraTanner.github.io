          <h2 id="box-model">Box Model</h2>
          <p>
            The <span>Box Model</span> in CSS refers to the box that surrounds
            each element. Each element can have padding, border, and margin
            (except for inline elements which cannot have top/bottom margin).
            The Box Model illustrates how the padding is inside the box, border
            at the edge of the box, and margin on the outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Dev Tools show a box model for each element. The following model
            is from the Box Model heading above.
          </p>
          <img
            class="center-img quarter-width"

          />
          <h2 id="flow-layout">Flow Layout</h2>
          <p>
            Flow Layout is the default layout mode HTML offers without any CSS
            modifications.
          </p>
          <div class="quote">
            "In Flow layout, every element will use a display value of either
            inline, block, or inline-block. This value governs how the Flow
            layout algorithm will place the element." -Josh Comeau
          </div>
          <p>
            <span>Inline</span> elements cannot have top and bottom margin, and
            their height and width cannot be changed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The exception is the <span>&lt;img&gt;</span> tag. It's an inline
            element, but it's width and height can be changed. However, it's
            best to change images to <span>display: block</span> in your CSS
            reset anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <span>&lt;button&gt;</span> tag is also a special inline element
            that allows for top/bottom margins.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Flow layout, you rely on margin, padding, and border to create
            the layout.
          </p>
          <h4>Center Elements with Margin</h4>
          <p>Think of margin as the gap between elements.</p>
          <p>
            You can horizontally center items with left and right margin set to
            auto.
          </p>
          <div class="quote">
            <p>
              "This only works for horizontal margin. Setting top/bottom margin
              to auto is equivalent to setting it to 0px*.
            </p>
            <p>
              This only works on elements with an explicit width. Block elements
              will naturally grow to fill the available horizontal space, so we
              need to give our element a width in order to center it." -Josh
              Comeau
            </p>
          </div>
          <h4>Margin Collapse</h4>
          <p>
            If you find margin doing unexpected things, it might be due to
            margin collapse. This happens when two margins share the same space.
            <!-- Learn the rules of margin collapse
            <a
              href="https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/css-for-js/01-rendering-logic-1/12-rules-of-margin-collapse"
              >here</a
            >. -->
          </p>
          <p>
            Margins only collapse in Flow Layout, the default CSS layout. They
            won't collapse with Flexbox or Grid. Also, only adjacent elements
            collapse. If the collapsing margins have different values, the
            bigger value wins. Padding or border will prevent margins from
            collapsing.
          </p>
          <div class="quote">
            <p>
              "What if we have multiple margins competing for the same space,
              and some are negative? If there are more than 2 margins involved,
              the algorithm looks like this:
            </p>
            <p class="indent-2">
              Find the largest positive margin<br />Find the largest negative
              margin<br />Add those two numbers together" -Josh Comeau
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Some developers have decided margin is too unpredictable and should
            be avoided. Better to use padding and layout when possible.
          </p>
          <h2 id="positioned-layout">Positioned Layout</h2>
          <p>
            In Positioned Layout, items can overlap. To create a positioned
            layout, use the <span>position</span> property. The default setting
            is <span>static</span>, which means there is no positioning set.
            Options for positioning are
            <span>relative, absolute, fixed,</span> or <span>sticky.</span>
          </p>
          <h4>Stacking Contexts</h4>
          <p>
            <span>Z-Index</span> has no effect on Flow layout elements. It works
            with Positioned layout, as well as Flexbox and Grid. The DOM order
            defines which overlapping elements sit in front of the others, but a
            positioned element will always sit in front of a non-positioned
            element. If you need to control the order further, use z-index. The
            default value is 0, and anything greater will promote that element
            in front of others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever an element is given a position (no matter which one:
            relative, absolute, etc.) AND a z-index (see definintion below), it
            creates a <span>stacking context.</span> In a stacking context, only
            siblings are compared to determine which element overlaps the other.
            No matter how high of a z-index you give a child element, it will
            never override the z-index of its parent element.
            <!-- <a
              href="https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/css-for-js/02-rendering-logic-2/07-stacking-contexts"

            > -->
          </p>
          <p>
            Other situations that create a new stacking context (from Josh
            Comeau):
          </p>

          <div class="quote">

              Setting opacity to a value less than 1<br />
              Setting position to fixed or sticky (No z-index needed for these
              values!)<br />
              Applying a mix-blend-mode other than normal<br />

              Explicitly creating a context with isolation: isolate

            <a

            >
            to help debug stacking contexts.
          </p> -->
          <h5>Isolation</h5>
          <p>
            Best way to control stacking contexts is to create them on purpose
            using the property designed for this purpose,
            <span>isolation: isolate;</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            This setting creates its own stacking context. That way, all of the
            children within it will only compare z-index values with each other
            and not with outside elements like nav bars, sticky headers, etc.
          </p>

            >
          </p> -->
          <h4>Relative Position</h4>
          <p>
            Setting <span>position: relative</span> by itself will do nothing!
            Use it in combination with top, bottom, left, and right properties.
            Think of it like a relative pushing you around. When you set
            position: relative and add a direction the push is coming from left:
            40px, then the item will be moved from that direction.
          </p>
          <div class="box"></div>
          <div class="box relative">Left: 40px</div>
          <div class="box"></div>
          <p>
            Cool thing about relative positioning is that the browser still
            thinks of the item as being in its original position. So unlike
            margin, relative positioning can shift an element without pushing
            anything around it!
          </p>

          <p>Even inline elements can be assigned relative positioning:</p>
          <p>
            This text has no positioning,
            <span class="inline-relative"
              >while this text is set to position: relative, bottom: 5px.</span
            >
          </p>
          <h4>Absolute Position</h4>
          <p>
            <span>Absolute positioning</span> pulls an element out of the flow
            of the page and puts it wherever specified by the properties top,
            right, bottom, left.
          </p>
          <div class="quote">
            'Being able to take elements out-of-flow is super handy. Any time
            you want an element to be "floating above" the content, like a
            tooltip or a dropdown or a modal, absolute positioning is your
            friend.' -Josh Comeau
          </div>
          <p>
            But, unexpected overlap can be a problem with absolute positioning.
            Also, a parent div will collapse if it has no height or width
            settings, and the child element inside of it is absolutely
            positioned.
            <!-- <a
              href="https://courses.joshwcomeau.com/css-for-js/02-rendering-logic-2/02-absolute"

            > -->
          </p>
          <h5>Center Elements</h5>
          <p>
            There's a <span>trick to center elements</span> using absolute
            positioning. Cool thing about it? It centers elements both
            <span>horizontally AND vertically</span>.
          </p>
          <div class="quote">
            <p>"There are 4 important ingredients for this trick to work:</p>

            <p class="indent-2">
              Absolute positioning (position: absolute)<br />Equal distances
              from each edge (ideally 0px)<br />A fixed size (defined width and
              height properties, fit-content works here)<br />Hungry margins
              (margin: auto)" -Josh Comeau
            </p>
          </div>
          <h5>Containing Blocks</h5>
          <p>
            Elements that are absolutely positioned are pulled out of the flow
            of the layout and ignore a lot of the rules of Flow layout. One of
            those rules is in regard to containing blocks. It doesn't matter if
            a child element is inside of a parent element in the HTML. When
            absolutely positioned, it will go outside of the parent element if
            told to do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            But! If the parent is also using any of the Positioned layouts, the
            child element will be forced to stay inside of the parent element.
            This can lead to unexpected behavior!
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, the child element disregards the padding of the parent
            element. Absolutely positioned elements ignore padding!
          </p>
          <p>
            Absolutely positioned elements ignore the overflow of parent
            elements as well.
          </p>
          <h4>Fixed Position</h4>
          <p>
            To use fixed positioning, give your element the declaration of
            <span>position: fixed</span> AND give it a location using
            <span>right, left, top, bottom.</span> If a fixed position element
            isn't given a location, it will remain in its default "in flow"
            position. If that default location happens to be off screen, when
            you scroll, the fixed item will never appear.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fixed positioning is similar to Absolute positioning in that it is
            pulled out of the flow of the document. However, it is different in
            that it is immune to scrolling.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your fixed position element IS scrolling, chances are there's a
            parent/grandparent element using the transform property. This can
            mess with fixed positioning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fixed position elements are immune to overflow settings. That's
            because the parent of fixed elements is the viewport, not the HTML
            elements.
          </p>
          <h4>Sticky Position</h4>
          <p>Sticky positioning is a blend between relative and fixed.</p>
          <div class="quote">
            <p>
              '[P]osition: sticky is the newest addition to the crew. The idea
              is that as you scroll, an element can "stick" to the edge. At that
              moment, it transitions from being relatively-positioned to being
              fixed-positioned.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to setting position: sticky, you also need to pick at
              least one edge to stick to (top, left, right, bottom). Most
              commonly, this is done with top: 0px.' <br />-Josh Comeau
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Cool thing about sticky headers: they stay in their containing
            blocks. So it will stick in place until the containing block is
            scrolled out of view.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sticky elements sometimes unexpectedly don't stick, especially if
            it's parent/grandparent container has overflow: hidden.

          <h2 id="flex-box">Flexbox</h2>
          <p>
            Flexbox is CSS's first intentional layout mechanism. Flexbox works
            best for elements in a single dimension: think of a straight line of
            elements, whether in a row or column, like a nav bar or a side bar.
            Flexbox can help to space out those elements and can also stretch or
            shrink those elements to fit in the space.
          </p>
          <h4>Parent and Children Elements</h4>
          <p>
            Important thing about Flexbox: there needs to be a container element
            that holds the flex items.
          </p>
          <ul>
            The following
            <span>flex container properties</span>
            are always set on the parent:
            <li>flex-direction</li>
            <li>flex-wrap</li>
            <li>flex-flow</li>
            <li>justify-content</li>
            <li>align-items</li>
            <li>align-content</li>
            <li>gap</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            While these
            <span>flex item properties</span>
            are set on the individual children:
            <li>order</li>
            <li>flex-grow</li>
            <li>flex-shrink</li>
            <li>flex-basis</li>
            <li>flex</li>
            <li>align-self</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Vertical Centering</h4>
          <p>
            Using Flexbox is the main way to vertically center items in a
            container. If your flex-direction is set to row (the default), it's
            a simple matter of adding <span>align-items: center</span> to the
            parent container. But! You might try this and nothing happens!
            That's probably because there is no <span>height</span> set on your
            parent container. You might try setting <span>height: 100%</span>,
            but still nothing may happen if you haven't also set both
            <span>html</span> and <span>body</span> to
            <span>height: 100%</span> as well. Setting the height to 100vh is
            another option, but 100vh doesn't work as well on mobile (the height
            is actually bigger than the viewport, strangely, and will make your
            centered elements be slightly off), so it's probably best to set
            heights on html, body, and the container.

          <h4>Flex Item Properties</h4>
          <p>
            The following properties are used on individual items within a
            flexbox.
          </p>
          <h5>Flex-grow & Flex-shrink</h5>
          <p>
            First, let's talk <span>hypothetical size</span>. Usually, width and
            height are set to specific measurements, and they will stick to that
            in other layouts. In Flexbox, width and height are hypothetical,
            meaning the declared size will be used only if there is sufficient
            space. If there's too much or too little space, you can specifically
            tell Flexbox which items you want to grow or shrink with the
            following properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Flex-grow</span> only has an effect if there is more space
            available than the size of the elements in the flexbox. The default
            setting is 0, and any number above that will say how much this item
            should grow compared to the other items in the Flexbox.
          </p>
          <p>
            Conversely, <span>flex-shrink</span> only applies if the available
            space is smaller than the hypothetical size of the content. It's
            important to note that the item cannot shrink to a smaller size than
            its content. Shrink only works if the hypothetical size is bigger
            than the min content.
          </p>
          <h5>Flex-basis</h5>
          <p>
            <span>Flex-basis</span> can be confusing, but it sets the width OR
            height of an element, depending on the flex-direction, so if it's a
            row, it's the width, and for column, it's height.
          </p>
          <p>
            If flex-basis AND a width or height are set, flex-basis has
            priority.
          </p>
          <h5>Flex Shorthand</h5>
          <p>
            The <span>Flex</span> shorthand does more than just shorten
            <span>flex-grow, flex-shrink,</span> and
            <span>flex-basis</span> into one property. It's the recommended way
            to get multiple elements to each have the same allotted space, even
            if their content is different. So if you set <span>flex: 1</span>,
            it sets flex-grow to 1, flex-shrink is already at 1 by default, and
            it sets flex-basis to 1, which is actually like saying there's no
            width or height. When there is no width or height, the elements will
            grow to take up equal amounts of space.

          <div class="quote">
            <p>
              '[F]lex: 1 will assign flex-grow: 1, but it will also set
              flex-basis: 0%. It won't affect the default value for flex-shrink,
              which is 1.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since flex-basis is a synonym for width in a flex row, we're
              effectively shrinking each child to have a “hypothetical width” of
              0px, and then distributing all of the space between each child.'
              -Josh Comeau
            </p>
          </div>
          <h4>Positioned Layout vs. Flexbox</h4>
          <p>
            If a child element in a flexbox is also given a positioned layout,
            like absolute or fixed,
            <span>positioned layout always wins</span>. In fact, the Flexbox
            will ignore that child element as if it doesn't exist!
          </p>
          <p>
            One exception is relative layout, because it doesn't cause the same
            conflict. Relative layout just tells an item to move a bit in
            relation to where it's already at, so it will decide where it's at
            based on Flexbox, then move relative to that.
          </p>
          <h2 id="grid">Grid</h2>
          <p>
            In case you didn't know, <span>CSS Grid</span> is by far the coolest
            layout mode yet. While Flexbox is designed for a single dimension,
            Grid is designed to handle two dimensions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The box below is a grid container with two columns and three rows.
          </p>
          <div class="grid-example">
            <div class="grid-item">
              <p>Each box is a div with a background color</p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item"></div>
            <div class="grid-item"></div>
            <div class="grid-item"></div>
            <div class="grid-item"></div>
            <div class="grid-item"></div>
          </div>
          <p>The styles for the grid container:</p>
          <div class="img-black">
            <img src="img/gridExample.png" class="half-width" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Notice how the grid container has a height, but no set width. The
            grid items within the container will automatically take up as much
            space as is available.
          </p>
          <p>
            But we can do much more with Grid. We can explicitly tell each grid
            item how many rows and columns of space we want them to span over.
            The grid below is identical to the one above, with three columns and
            two rows, but the grid items have been told to span more columns and
            rows.
          </p>
          <div class="grid-example">
            <div class="grid-item box-1">
              <p>Grid-column: <span class="no-break">1 / 3</span></p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item box-2">
              <p>
                Grid-column: <span class="no-break">3 / 4</span><br />Grid-row:
                <span class="no-break">1 / 3</span>
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item box-3">
              <p>Grid-column: <span class="no-break">2 / 3</span></p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Another way to accomplish the same task is by using
            <a
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-areas"
              >grid template areas</a
            >. These are like variable names you can assign to each area.
          </p>
          <h4>Fluid Grids</h4>
          <p>
            Grid has its own <span>minmax</span> function that can help to
            create fluid grids. Combined with <span>repeat: auto-fill</span>, it
            can resize how many grid items can fit on a row. The following grid
            is made with this line of code:
            <span
              >grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(100px, 1fr));
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>Try resizing the window to see what this grid is capable of.</p>
          <div class="grid-fluid">
            <div class="grid-item"></div>
            <div class="grid-item"></div>
            <div class="grid-item"></div>
            <div class="grid-item"></div>
            <div class="grid-item"></div>
            <div class="grid-item"></div>
            <div class="grid-item"></div>
            <div class="grid-item"></div>
          </div>
          <h2 id="columns">Columns, Floats & More</h2>
          <p>
            There are more layout modes that can help you achieve different
            effects.
          </p>
          <h4>Multi-column Layout</h4>
          <p>
            Did you know there was a CSS property called <span>column</span>?
            Simply define your number of columns, add a
            <span>column-gap</span> to give some space between columns, and the
            column algorithm does the rest of the work to keep the columns an
            even length.
          </p>
          <h4>Floats</h4>
          <p>
            Floats were used before Flexbox, and isn't seen as much anymore,
            however, there are a few things only floats can do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using <span>float: left</span> (or right), is one of the easiest
            ways to get text to wrap around an img.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can even get your text to wrap around circle-shaped images and
            custom polygon shapes with the <span>shape-outside</span> property.
          </p>
        </div>
      </main>
    </div>
    <div class="modal-background no-display"></div>
