          <h2 id="media-queries">Media Queries</h2>
          <p>
            Responsive design in CSS refers to the ability to change the layout
            based on the size of the screen, so the same html can be used for
            desktop, tablet, and mobile.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main tool in the arsenal of responsive design is the @media
            query.
          </p>
          <p>
            Check out my awesome row of boxes (on desktop), only one box (on
            mobile). When the screen is less than 800px, three boxes become two.
            When the screen is less than 480px, only one box shows.
          </p>
          <div id="responsive-boxes">
            <div></div>
            <div class="no-display-mini"></div>
            <div class="no-display-mobile"></div>
          </div>
          <p>
            The above is accomplished with the following style, which makes the
            third box (#hidden) disappear when the screen reaches the indicated
            width:
          </p>
          <div class="img-black">
            <img class="half-width" src="img/mediaQuery.png" />
          </div>
          <h4>Where to Put Media Queries</h4>
          <p>
            Put media queries at the end of your CSS file. They override other
            styles, and as we know, the last styles in the cascading style sheet
            get preference, so your media queries will fail if they come before
            the styles they are intended to override.
          </p>
          <h2 id="breakpoints">Breakpoints</h2>
          <p>
            Breakpoints are cutoffs for different viewing devices. The following
            are the instructor's, Josh Comeau's, recommended breakpoints:
          </p>
          <div class="quote">
            0-550px — Mobile <br />550-1100px — Tablet <br />1100-1500px —
            Laptop<br />
            1500+px — Desktop
          </div>
          <p>
            The modern iphone has around 375px, but some androids have 400px, so
            it's best to give a buffer area to allow for differences in mobile
            devices, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            While these recommended breakpoints are in pixels, it's really best
            to use rem for breakpoints. For example, if a user increases their
            default font size, it might be better to have the tablet layout on
            desktop in those cases, because rem will scale with the default font
            size.
            <!-- <a

              >rem will scale with the default font size</a
            >. -->
          </p>
          <h4>The All Important Order of Media Query Breakpoints</h4>
          <p>
            So great, you've got some breakpoints figured out, and if you write
            an exclusive media query that only allows for the styles within to
            work if the screen is bigger than 550px AND if the screen is smaller
            than 1100px, then go ahead and slap that baby down in any order...
          </p>
          <p>But, developers often write their queries like this:</p>
          <div class="img-black">
            <img class="half-width" src="img/mediaBreakpoints.png" />
          </div>
          <p>
            If you'll notice, the first query applies to desktop and smaller. It
            will apply as long as the screen is smaller than 1500px. Now, when
            the screen gets smaller than 1100px, why does it switch to yellow at
            all? The blue background still applies!
          </p>
          <p>
            The answer: the <strong>order</strong> of the media queries. As
            always, the last style will be applied if there are conflicting
            styles. This means you need to put your least exclusive styles
            first. If the desktop style in this example were the last style in
            the list, it would always apply. None of the others would show up.
          </p>

          <h2 id="clamping">Clamping</h2>
          <p>
            Before we explain clamping, let's talk about how min-width and
            max-width can help with responsive design.
          </p>
          <div class="responsive-clamp">
            <p>
              This box has a min-width of 500px and a max-width of 700px, as
              well as a width of 80%. When all of these values are set, it
              allows this box to respond to the amount of space it has been
              given. Width: 80% is its ideal width, but it is not allowed to
              grow smaller than 500px nor larger than 900px. These constraints
              can be quite handy when creating responsive webpages, because you
              won't want the box to remain at 80% on mobile, so the min-width
              will keep the box wider as the page shrinks. However! If the
              screen goes smaller than 500px, it will create a scrollbar and
              break the layout! In fact, it was breaking my layout. I had to
              change its settings to the clamp property below to fix it.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>The <span>clamp</span> property. It looks like this:</p>
          <div class="img-black">
            <img class="half-width" src="img/responsive-clamp.png" />
          </div>
          <p>
            The first value is <span>min-width</span>, the second is the
            <span>ideal width</span>, and the third is the
            <span>max-width</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this might look like only a shorthand, it can help us fix the
            problem of scrollbars being introduced once we hit the min-width,
            because now the max-width property can be used in combination with
            clamp.
          </p>
          <div class="img-black">
            <img class="half-width" src="img/responsive-clamp-max.png" />
          </div>
          <div class="responsive-clamp">
            <p>
              This box will never exceed 100% of the screen width, and thus will
              never cause a scrollbar. This is a powerful combination for
              responsive design.
            </p>
          </div>
          <h2 id="typography">Typography on Mobile</h2>
          <p>
            Typography on mobile and desktop should be the same for the most
            part. For basic body text, the size should be at least 16px (1rem).
            (Remember to use rem for font-size).
          </p>
          <h4>Default Sizes</h4>
          <p>
            The problem on mobile is that some html elements have a default size
            smaller than 16px. Textarea and input default to a smaller size, yet
            iOS will automatically zoom in on text input fields with font-sizes
            smaller than 16px. This means that by default, text inputs will
            break your layout and zoom oddly on mobile. It's an easy fix but
            important to remember:
          </p>
          <div class="img-black">
            <img class="half-width" src="img/input-font-size.png" />
          </div>
          <p>
            You should probably include this in a CSS reset, but you could also
            put the value to inherit, as long as your html or body text is set
            to at least 16px.
          </p>
          <h4>Headings</h4>
          <p>
            Headings on mobile, however, might need to be adjusted, because
            large, long headings can take up the entire screen.
          </p>
          <p>
            One way is to use media queries and make the headings a more
            appropriate size.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another way is to use <span>fluid typography</span>. Fluid
            typography can be achieved by using <span>vw</span>, or viewing
            width. However, you'll want to use <span>clamp</span> as well,
            because a heading of 6vw will become VERY large on wide screens and
            unreadably tiny on small screens, so it's important to set mininum
            and maximum sizes. Something like:
            <span> font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 6vw, 3rem);</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            But...there's a problem. Using a fluid unit like vw disables zoom.
            That means if the user zooms in to make the font bigger, it won't
            work for the headings. To fix this, mix units on the ideal size in
            the clamp property:
            <span> font-size: clamp(1.5rem, 4vw + 1rem, 3rem);</span> This will
            make the text zoomable again.
          </p>

            in a flexbox, not just font-size.
